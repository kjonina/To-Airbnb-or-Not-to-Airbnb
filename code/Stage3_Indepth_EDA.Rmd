```
**Comment:**
It is clear from this graph that there are some parts of Ireland that have more AirBnB listings than others. It is easy to see that there are more properties available on the coast than inland. 


### Room Types are available on AirBnB

```
**Comment:**
It was surprising to see that Kerry has more AirBnB listings available than Dublin. It is also important to note that the first seven in the table (except for Dublin) are all on the Wild Atlantic Way. 

### Summary of AirBnB listings
```{r echo=FALSE}
# examining the mean and the max or price for each county
df %>% 
  select(county, price, minimum_nights) %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  summarise(no_of_listings = n(),
            min_price = min(price), 
            median_price = median(price), 
            mean_price = mean(price),
            max_price = max(price),
            min_nights = min(minimum_nights), 
            median_min_nights = median(minimum_nights),
            mean_min_nights = mean(minimum_nights),
            max_min_nights = max(minimum_nights)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(no_of_listings))

```
**Comment:**
Even though Kerry has more options for accomondation than Dublin, it is also more expensive. 

### When are most AirBnB listings Available?
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# eamining the number of AirBnB listings available in each month
summarise_df %>% 
  select(listing_id, month) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(count_distinct = n_distinct(listing_id))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# creating a dataset of the table above
sum_df <- summarise_df %>% 
  select(listing_id, month) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  #conting distinct AirBnB listing's id
  summarize(count_distinct = n_distinct(listing_id))


sum_df %>%

  layout(xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),
         title = "When are the most AirBnB listings Available?")
```
**Comment:**
There are less AirBnB listings available in the summer, than the winter. However, it is possible that the AirBnB listings are not yet for the summer.

### Breakdown by County
```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  count(room_type, county) %>%
  mutate(room_type = fct_reorder(room_type, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~room_type, y = ~n, color = ~room_type,
          hovertemplate = ~paste("County:", county, "<br>", "Accomodation Type:", room_type, "<br>", 
                                 "Number of AirBnB listings:", n)) %>%
  add_bars(showlegend = FALSE,  frame = ~county) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),
         title = "What type of accomodation is most common in each county?")
```
**Comment:**
By clicking on different counties, it is possible to see the difference between counties on types of accommodation available.  Dublin has more private rooms available than entire rental units. However, in Galway and Cork, there are more entire rental units available than private rooms. 

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~room_type, y = ~price, color = ~room_type) %>%
  add_boxplot(frame = ~county, showlegend = FALSE) %>% 
  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
    yaxis = list(title = "Price in Euro",
         zerolinecolor = '#ffff',
         zerolinewidth = 2,
         gridcolor = 'ffff',
         range = list(0, 450)), 
         title="What is the price of each type of accomodation for each county?",
    boxmode = "group") 
```

**Comment:**
It is possible to select the same county in the two graphs above and compare. For example, Dublin has more entire rental units than private rooms, entire rental units are more expensive than private rooms. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# creating a dataset of the table above
sum_month_df <- large_df %>% 
  select(id, month, county) %>% 
  group_by(month, county) %>% 
  #conting distinct AirBnB listing's id
  summarize(count_distinct = n_distinct(id))

sum_month_df %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~month, y = ~count_distinct, color = ~month,
          hovertemplate = ~paste("County:", county, "<br>", "Month:", month, "<br>", 
                                 "Number of AirBnB listings:", count_distinct)) %>%
  add_bars(frame = ~county, showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),
         title = "When are the most AirBnB listings Available?")
```
**Comment:**
It is interesting to compare AirBnB listings for each month and county. Big cities like Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick, including Kerry, have less AirBnB listings in teh summer. It is unclear why this is the case, considering more tourists come to Ireland during the summer. 

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# eamining the number of AirBnB listings available in each month
large_df %>% 
  select(id, month, county) %>% 
  group_by(county,month) %>% 
  summarize(count_distinct = n_distinct(id))
```
**Comment:**
Tablee examined the number in the graph above. Less AirBnB listings are available in the summer than any other time of the year.

### Conclusion
The initial examination of the data, shows that there are more AirBnB Listing in Kerry than Dublin. Top 7 county with AirBnB listings  are on the Wild Atlantic Way. The map of Ireland shows the density of the number of listings on the coast. For some reason, there are less AirBnB listings in the summer than the winter. Number of room types differs depedning on the county. Dublin City, Cork City and Galway City,   The county breakdown examination shows no difference in price or mininum nights required to stay regardless of room type.

**Comment:**
Map of Ireland represents the density of AirBnB listings, highlighting the areas that are in RTZs (in red). Athough Dublin City, Cork City and Galway City are all in RTZs, it is possible to see the huge amount of AirBnB listings available, which can be affecting the Irish Housing Crisis.  

### Summary of RTZs

  summarise(count = n(),
            min_price = min(price),

            mean_min_nights = mean(minimum_nights),
            max_min_nights = max(minimum_nights)) 
```

**Comment:**
There are more entire rental units and private rooms available outside of RTZs than there are in the RTZs. 

### Breakdown of AirBnB listings by Accomodation Type and RPZ

          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),

```
**Comment:**
Table above is summarised with this graph. There are more entire rental units and private rooms available outside of RTZs than there are in the RTZs. However, this could be due to fact that there are more houses in general outside the RTZs than inside the RTZs, which would show more AirBnB listings outside RTZs than inside RTZs.

### Breakdown of Price by: Room Type and non-/RTZ
```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~room_type, y = ~price, color = ~rent_pressure_zone) %>%

    yaxis = list(title = "Price in Euro",

         title="What rooom type is cheaper <br> inside or outside of RTZs",
    boxmode = "group") 
   
```
**Comment:**
Although, there is a difference between entire rental unit and private/shared room on price, there is no big difference between renting private/shared room inside or outside the RTZ. However, an entire rental unit is slightly more expensive in RTZs than outside RTZs.

         title = "When are the most AirBnB listings Available <br> in RTZ?")
```
**Comment:**
In the graph above visusalises the table above. As seen above, there are overall less AirBnB listings in RTZs than in Non-RTZs. Furthermore, the trend follows for the month: less AirBnBs are available during the summer than in the winter. 

### RPZ: Conclusion
Map of Ireland shows that there are a lot of AirBnB listings in RTZs, which would affect the number of accommodation available for the housing market, to buy or to rent. There are as many entire rental units as private rooms in RTZs. There are more entire rental units outside of RTZs because there are more areas not in RTZs than there are in RTZs. At first glance, due to the amount of AirBnB listings in RTZs, it could be argued to the government that it could potentially reduce the pressure on the Irish housing market and reduce the Housing Crisis in RTZs.  

## Entire Rental Unit
A new dataset was created where AirBnB listings were selected that offered entire rental unit.  This new dataset was used for this section of the report.

**Comment:**
However, when comparing total potential income (available nights * price) and annual income (rent_in_ireland.csv  * 12), it seems that most landlords are missing out on the potential annual rent. THis could be due to the fact that the rental unit is not available all year around.

### Threshold Examinination
As previously stated, homeowners in RTZs (RPZs) are required to apply for planning permission if they let out their entire home (principal private residence) for short-term lets of more than 90 days in total while they are away. Principal private residence is the place where one ordinarily live.

```{r echo=FALSE}

There are very small amount of properties in the Rent Pressures Zones that are over 90 day threshold that would require planning permission.

``` 
**Comment:**
There seems to be a difference in mininum nights to stay in Entire rental units available in RTZs are more expensive than outside of RTZs. Short-term lease is up to 15 days, so that is why is very small window of stay. 

### Entire Rental Unit: Conclusion 
There is more entire rental units in Kerry than in other places in Ireland. When availability was examined, it was clear that not all entire rental units were available all year around. When examining the months of year, it is clear that there are less entire rental units available in the summer than other times of the year. It is unclear why this occurs and what is the landlord's motivation behind this. Majority of stays of entire rental units are available for short-term stays (mininum nights under 14 days) and availability for the year is below 90 days. In RTZs, there are only 2,356 properties that require planning permission (availability over 90 days in the year and in RTZs). This would mean that there are over 2,000 properties that could be placed into long-term rental market to ease the Housing Crisis in Ireland. Analysis of potential income from rent vs AirBnB shows that most of the AirBnB earn less than the potential rental annual income. Of course, this is because most entire rental units on AirBnB are not available all year around, motivation for this is unclear.

**Comment:**
However, when comparing total potential income (available nights * price) and annual income (rent_in_ireland.csv  * 12), it seems that most landlords are missing out on the potential annual rent. THis could be due to the fact that the rental unit is not available all year around.

**Comment:**
In the table above, number of listings of private rooms is summarised by RTZ and month. A table of above illustration. 

### Private Room by RTZ and Threshold (under/over 90 days)
As previously stated, homeowners in RTZs (RPZs) are required to apply for planning permission if they let out their entire home (principal private residence) for short-term lets of more than 90 days in total while they are away. Principal private residence is the place where one ordinarily live. However, there is no threshold for private rooms. It is still interesting to examine this relationship

```{r echo=FALSE}
private_room %>%
  count(rent_pressure_zone, threshold_day_90) %>%
  mutate(threshold_day_90 = fct_reorder(threshold_day_90, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~threshold_day_90, y = ~n, color = ~rent_pressure_zone,
          
          hovertemplate = ~paste("RTZ:", rent_pressure_zone, "<br>",
                        "Threshhold:", threshold_day_90, "<br>", 
                        "Number of AirBnB listings:", n,"<br>")) %>%
  add_bars(showlegend=FALSE, colors = pressure_colors) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),
         title='AirBnB listings by Threshold and RTZ')
   
```
**Comment:**
There are 2,124 private rooms that are available over 90 days in RTZs. If the same rules were applied to private rooms as entire rental units, then these properties would require planning permission. 

### Stay Duration

    yaxis = list(title = "Price in Euro",
         zerolinecolor = '#ffff',
         zerolinewidth = 2,
         gridcolor = 'ffff',
         range = list(0, 450)), 
         title="What Private Room are cheaper: by Term and RTZs?",
    boxmode = "group") 

```
**Comment:**
There are absolutely no difference between private room listings inside and outside RTZs and term type (under/over-90). This means that regardless of nights stayed in RTZs, the price is very similar. 

### Private Room: Conclusion
In a lot of counties, there are as many private rooms as there are entire rental units. Dublin has the most number of private rooms, all of which are in the RTZ.
There are no planning permission required for long-term stays in RTZs with availability for over-90 days. In RTZs, there are only 3,011 private rooms available on AirBnB, while there are 3,152 private rooms outside RTZs. Most of the properties in Rent Pressure could be placed into long-term rental market to ease the Housing Crisis in Ireland. Analysis of potential income from rent vs AirBnB shows that most of the AirBnB earn less than the potential rental annual income. Of course, this is because most entire rental units on AirBnB are not available all year around, motivation for this is unclear.


There are 2,124 private rooms that are available over 90 days in RTZs. If the same rules were applied to private rooms as entire rental units, then these properties would require planning permission. Identifying this should help lobbyists of change to regulations to include private rooms in their cut-offs.

**Comment:**  
This graph shows less shared rooms available during summer months in RTZs. There is no big difference between availability of shared rooms in Non-RTZs regardless of year. For the first time, there are more shared rooms in RTZs than Non-RTZs. This is probably because tourists in RTZs would be willing to share a room to reduce costs while travelling.

### Shared Room: Conclusion
There are only 119 shared rooms available spread out all over Ireland. In major cities, such as Dublin City, Cork City and Galway City, these shared rooms can be used by students going to college in those cities. It is unclear why there would be shared rooms in other counties, where there is no major shortage of accomodation.

A new dataset was created where 5 AirBnB hosts with the most properties were selected.  This new dataset was used for this section of the report.  

### Summary of Top AirBnB Hosts
```{r echo=FALSE}
# displaying the hosts with the most listings on AirBnB
df %>% 
  select(rent_pressure_zone, host_id, host_name, price,minimum_nights) %>% 
  filter(rent_pressure_zone == 'RPZ') %>% 
  group_by(host_id, host_name) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            min_price = min(price), 
            median_price = median(price), 
            mean_price = mean(price),
            max_price = max(price),
            min_nights = min(minimum_nights), 
            median_min_nights = median(minimum_nights),
            mean_min_nights = mean(minimum_nights),
            max_min_nights = max(minimum_nights)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) 
```
**Comment:**
Table above examines the AirBnB listings by counting the number of listings in RTZs for each host, ordering it in ascending order. One hosts has over 200 AirBnB listings. 

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# creating a dataframe with host_id and count, arranging by count
rpz_top_hosts <-  df %>% 
  select(rent_pressure_zone, host_id, host_name) %>% 
  filter(rent_pressure_zone == 'RPZ') %>% 
  group_by(host_id) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  # get all hosts with more than 10 properties on AirBnB
  filter( count > 10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

rpz_df <-  df %>% 
  filter(rent_pressure_zone == 'RPZ')

# creating a list of the top 5 hosts using host_id
rpz_top_hosts_list <- c(rpz_top_hosts$host_id)

# creating a new dataframe that only selects host_in in Top 20 hosts
rpz_top_df <- rpz_df %>% 
  filter(host_id %in% rpz_top_hosts_list)
```

### Location of Properties owned by Top AirBnB listings

fig <- fig %>% add_markers(

                                                  "Availability (in nights)", available_nights, "<br>"))
fig <- fig %>% layout(

**Comment:**
Map of Ireland examines the location of AirBnB listings in RTZs for those Top hosts.  By double clicking on the id in the legend, it possible to just select one host and examine the location of their AirBnBs in RTZs. Some hosts has several AirBnB listings in different counties. It is unclear how they manage their properties for AirBnB.  

### Room Type in Top Hosts in RTZs by County
```{r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
rpz_top_df %>%
  count(room_type, county) %>%
  mutate(room_type = fct_reorder(room_type, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~county, y = ~n, color = ~county,
          hovertemplate = ~paste("Accomodation Type:", room_type, "<br>", 
                                 "County:", county, "<br>", 
                                 "Number of AirBnB listings:", n)) %>%
  add_bars(showlegend = FALSE,  frame = ~room_type) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(title = "Number of AirBnB listings"),
          title = "What is the breakdown by Top Hosts properties in RTZ <br> by room type and County?")
```
**Comment:**
Dublin City has the most AirBnB hosts with properties regardless of room type. There are also more private rooms than entire rental units. Galway City and Cork City also have hosts that have many AirBnB listings. However, there are more entire rental units than private rooms in those cities.

### Top Hosts: Conclusion
There are individuals who hold a lot of property in RTZs. It is unclear how those individuals manage their properties around Ireland. It could be suggested that having too many properties on AirBnB should be part of planning permission. This would allow landlords to have constant tenants and not worry about managing their AirBnB properties around Ireland.
