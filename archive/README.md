# Better Than Renting? To Airbnb or Not to Airbn.... 

In July 2024, in the process of revision. 

## Issues with Archived Story
The previous story is possible to read from the 'archive' but it way too TL:DR.

Changes to the code made:
- split code into 4 different stages
- In Stage 1, 9 million rows from calendar.csv are summarised.
- In Stage 2, listings.csv is cleaned and simple EDA, examining correlations
- In Stage 3, I delved into data exploration and was not sure what I was looking for.
- In Stage 4, I focus my storytelling, eliminating a lot of other stories that can be told with the data, choosing to only tell one. 

*Failed to identify the audience*

Through my analysis, I identified Irish landlords and the Irish government as my audience, I failed to truly identify my audience. 

*Too Many Stories*

I tried to tell too many stories, only scratching the surface and failing to dive into any of them in depth. In my original story, I mentioned students and statistics about homelessness, I just kept adding in dataset. 

*Research Questions not defined*

Because I failed to identify the research question... What does 'What is the impact of AirBnB on Irish Housing Crisis?' even mean?

*Failed to define terms*

I used the words ' more profitable' too carelessly, failing to define the phrase. 
Had I done this in the first place, I would have swiftly realised that there is a formula for profit (revenue - expenses), which I could not comment on because I had no expenses data.
The phrase that would be more suitable to the statement I was making would have been 'bring more revenue'.


I also used the words 'Housing Crisis'  without defining what that actually mean. The term is used to describe the lack of rental units and the high cost of purchasing a house. 

*Failed to make money talk*

I stated that landlords would have made more money by long-term renting their property out. 

But I failed to state by how much. 

Creating a statement that would clearly state: 'By AirBnBing you property for X months out of the year, you are losing out on an X amount of extra revenue.'

Money talks.
